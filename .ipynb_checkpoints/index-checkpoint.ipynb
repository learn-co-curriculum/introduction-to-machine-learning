To go back to our example, instead of writing a program that handles all different types of user activity, the program can use this activity to conclude likely attributes about a user and then design a program that responds to these attributes."

For example, let's say that we do not have any user signups, and only have user activity information.  Our user activity may indicate certain useful groupings based on various search activity, or visitation activity.  Based on similar groupings of activities, we can categorize our users: those who prefer early dinners at family restaurants, versus those who like late night spots with live music.  So the algorithm does not start with some information pre-categorized.  Instead the output of the algorithm itself may be a label or categorization."
